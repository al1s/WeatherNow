### Yet another weather app - WeatherNow

This repo contains the project files created within FreeCodeCamp curriculum. User stories:

* I can see the weather in my current location.
* I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Details of the implementation are in the blog post - http://al1s.github.io/posts/plan-and-done-for-july-26-2017/.
